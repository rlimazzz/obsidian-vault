Nodes : Are the basic building blocks.
	Green Nodes are used for interface.
	

Scenes : Container for Nodes, they also manage what is displayed in the game.

Writing code in Godot : You attach a script to a node, then you can change the properties of the node itself (position, size, rotation). You can also change other nodes, create new nodes, target other scenes, even get data from the internet. Godot organizes the code via functions. Functions whose start with _ are pre built godot functions.
